- I'm a generalist engineer with a bent towards backend and
  [DevOps](https://twitter.com/devops_borat/status/41587168870797312). 
- I like long walks by the beach, candlelit dinners, monitoring, 
  "permissionless innovation," AWS, and working in Linux.

    of an automated genome sequencing lab.
  - Wrote and introduced a tool that allows individual devs to safely create 
    and deploy new services without any ops intervention.
  - Modernized the infrastructure of over ten systems with Docker,
    AWS, monitoring, and continuous deployment.
  - Automated finance ETL jobs away from painful once-per-month ordeals to
    nightly exports using Puppet and Python.
  - Improved developer experience by introducing
    various monitoring tools including [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/)
    and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

    multiple times a day while rapidly growing from 4 to ~50 engineers. 
  - Resurrected QA, [automated it](https://blog.percolate.com/2012/11/tools-we-use/).
  - Resurrected testing, [automated it](https://blog.percolate.com/2013/02/introducing-jennifer/).
