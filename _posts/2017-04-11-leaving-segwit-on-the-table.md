title: ASICBOOST & leaving SegWit on the table
layout: post

One thing that confuses me about the scaling
debate happening in Bitcoin right now is that a significant number of people
apparently want to leave SegWit on the table in spite of the huge benefits
it offers that are unrelated to scaling.

SegWit is the most well-tested way to alleviate transaction malleability and
quadratic sighashing attacks. It creates an avenue for easy improvement of
Bitcoin's scripting language, which will allow for more advanced smart
contract features. It opens the door to an exciting world of protocol
interaction with Lightning and other networks. Scaling, or increasing
transaction throughput of the network, can be thought of as completely
peripheral to [the benefits of
SegWit](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/). 

As a fairly impartial observer without much skin in the game (aside from a few
Bitcoins and small Core contributions), SegWit looks to me like the obvious
way to move the protocol forward, regardless of the blocksize angle.

In fact, if I were, e.g., a Bitcoin Unlimited supporter, I'd be inclined to get
SegWit activated and *then* try for a hardfork. After all, benefiting from
Core's work and activating/adopting SegWit doesn't mean that you necessarily
submit to their continued reign over the protocol in the future. Why not
selfishly reap the benefits and then take a crack at pursuing a fork?

To leave SegWit on the table seems fairly irrational to me -- it feels like
too big an oversight. And I certainly don't think anyone who has a 
technical horse in this race is dumb enough to miss its obvious benefits, 
which creates interesting circumstantial evidence in the case of ASICBOOST.

If we agree that SegWit has significant benefits unrelated to scaling, and its
adoption doesn't necessarily lock anyone into the Core implementation going
forward, the question remains: why fight SegWit? 

The [recent revelations re:
ASICBOOST](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-controversy-asicboost-allegations-explained/)
provide a convincing (if not unproven) narrative on why people who are rational,
intelligent, and savvy with the protocol would be ignoring (and in certain cases
antagonizing) an otherwise net-positive change. Unless I'm missing some
technical aspect which would explain how SegWit activation locks in Core
dominance, it doesn't make sense that a significant plurality of a community
invested in Bitcoin's success wouldn't be for a SegWit activation.

I can completely understand arguing over the next steps, and I can understand
the desire for increased transaction throughput, but SegWit itself seems like a
given.

The most plausible explanation for me is that there is a vested interest in not
changing block header contents due to ASICBOOST (and undiscovered ilk), and that
interest has trickled down from powerful mining incumbents to well-intended
but unaware technical participants.

The last few paragraphs are pretty heavy speculation (and I'm happy to be
corrected), but I'm unable to see of a more convincing explanation.
