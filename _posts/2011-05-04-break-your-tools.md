title: Break your tools
---

Ethics and ideas are tools, just like the text editor I'm using right now.  In
particular, a system of ethics is a very valuable tool because it directs your
actions. 

Those ethics and ideas that you harbor demand more attempts at disassembly,
abuse, reconstruction, interrogation, and other methods of testing from you than
*any* others that you encounter. When you grant validity---when you say yes---to
a principle, framework, or idea, it becomes a tool that you rely on.  Make damn
sure that it works.

Your friends can help you with this process, whether or not they have tools that
work. Get into arguments. Invite breakage: it can only help you develop the
means for better decision-making.
