title: Break your tools
---

Those principles and ideas that you harbor must attract more attempts at
disassembly, abuse, reverse-engineering, reconstruction, interrogation, and
other methods of error-detection than *any* others that you encounter.  When you
grant validity---when you say yes---to a principle, framework, or idea, it
becomes a tool that you rely on. Make damn sure that it works.

Your friends can help you with this process, whether or not they have tools. Get
into arguments. Invite breakage: it can only help you.
