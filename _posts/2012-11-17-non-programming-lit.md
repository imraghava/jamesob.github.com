Occasionally I'll come across a piece of literature that has value beyond
whatever specific context it's written within. This usually indicates to me
something of high value.

Because programming is so conceptual, it's ripe for these kind of cute tie-ins
with other creative processes. I've come across a few books that have provided
lessons and analogues that really made me rethink (and ultimately improve) the
way I write and structure code; here are some of them.


## Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

Robert Pirsig's book made a big splash in the '70s, but many of my generation
missed out on the (justified) hype. I didn't pick this book up until about a 
year ago, but I'm glad I did.

It's about the cross-country travels of a previously-insane man, who narrates,
and his son. A few bedrock issues in philosophy are discussed (for example, the
analytic-synthetic dichotomy) in an entertaining way, but the author also goes
into various thinking "traps" that are often encountered during the performance
of motorcycle maintenance. Unsurprisingly, these same traps can be applied to
the context of debugging faulty code.

But the most valuable thing I got out of this book wasn't a discussion of
thinking-traps; it was what Pirsig had to say about Quality, the centerpiece of
the book.

Pirsig considers Quality to be a third party in the observer-observed pair,
making it a trinity. In less heady language: Quality is something that is
outside and independent of us, and the best that we can do is attempt to be
a channel that facilitates Quality.
 
> Quality is the continuing stimulus which our environment puts upon us to
> create the world in which we live. All of it. Every last bit of it.

> *Chapter 20*
                                                            

Once I realized this and processed it, there were big psychological changes to
my temperament as an engineer. I became less mired in patterns that were
attractive only because I knew them; less convinced that *I* always had the
right answer.  I became more receptive and loss hostile to other people's code
reviews since my judgement mechanism had shifted from "this does or doesn't
sound the way I'd do it" to "this is or isn't a facilitation of Quality."

Of course that criteria raises a more general question about what Quality is 
in terms of code, but there are numerous other sources for that.

Pirsig's work is wonderful, and I'm sure I'll revisit this book a few times.


## Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology

I suspect (but don't hope) that the mention of Ayn Rand is going to halve the
audience. That being said, the ideas presented in [her work on
epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Objectivist_Epistemology)
are almost completely non-political. Even if you recoil at the thought of her,
her cranky attitude, and the occasionally obnoxious troop of devotees
surrounding her, I think this book is a fascinating presentation of how human
beings turn sensations into understanding.

It is in that topic that I think there's a lot of value for programmers in this
book. An understanding of how people hierarchically organize an understanding 
of the world around them is a real aid in designing software that is usable
and extendible by other people. Rand effectively builds up the object-oriented
paradigm using different language, e.g. integration/differentiation for 
superclass/subclass,
