Here's a profile of my approximate yearly expenses, as generated by the
budget-projection library I'm working on:

    Total expenses: -26763.315821

I would imagine that your profile looks similar. Clearly, something like
Netflix (or any other service recurring monthly, save rent) isn't the
bottleneck here. As in software optimization, you have to look at the inner
loops --- the costs you incur most often --- and reduce those. For example, the
food that you eat, or the coffee you buy. A cappuccino per day at $3.50 (cost
of a decent one in Brooklyn) will cost you nearly **$1300 per year**.

This projection is after taking into account that I'll be cooking most of my
meals at home. When I was eating out more frequently, food was (predictably)
more expensive. I've estimated lunch/dinner at $8 a pop, which may sound
slightly optimistic, but is attainable. Today's lunch consisted of fried arctic
char and a batch of asparagus ($8 on the nose). Tonight's dinner consisted of
two eggs, three sausages, peppers, and mushrooms (a whopping $3.80). I have
cheated slightly: I ate strawberries and raspberries before dinner.
