title: "The crisis is Keynesianism"

This morning, an article by Felix Salmon, entitled [*America's job
crisis*](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/06/01/americas-jobs-crisis/),
popped up on my Percolate brew. This is a ripe example of the prevalent
misunderstanding of basic economics that is so frequently seen today, and a
callback to the Keynesian mindset that has created much of the economic strife
before us.

Salmon complains that a "market failure" has resulted in a poor job-creation
rate. Addressing the basic problem with this argument: job numbers are not the
end-all-be-all indicator of success. Were jobs the ultimate harbinger of
prosperity in society, government would simply, as Friedman said, mandate that
we farm with spoons. It is missing the point to equate job creation with a
healthy economy.

Moving on: of a recent increase in corporate profit-margins, Felix writes, 
> Just look at the amount of money which is flowing straight to corporations'
> bottom lines, and not being put to good, productive work. Corporate profits
> now account for significantly more than 10% of GDP: that's never happened
> before.

This statement in itself reveals a severe misunderstanding of how the economy
works. What does Mr. Salmon think happens to the capital once it has rushed to
"corporation's bottom lines?" He must think that each Apple board member takes
his freshly-earned cash home to hide it under his mattress or simply burn it
in an oil drum.

Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to preserve a large amount of
wealth, that wealth must be *injected back into the economy* via the purchase
of assets. These "bottom lines" can't unproductively sit on cash, or that
wealth will whither away under inflation.

Let's relax my argument and assume that the nascent Facebook millionaires don't
want to preserve their wealth, and so they extract from the mattress only to
spend on themselves. Where exactly does Mr. Salmon think *that* money is going
that is such a black hole of productivity?  Ostensibly, he doesn't understand
that spending money is tantamount to fueling the economy, even when it is done
by wealthy businessmen.

Next, Salmon presents his grand solution: borrow and spend ourselves out of a 
crisis.
> The government can borrow at 1.45%: it should do so, in vast quantities, and
> invest that money back into the economy itself. Take a few hundred billion
> dollars and use it to fix our broken infrastructure, to re-hire all those
> laid-off teachers and firefighters, to provide some kind of safety net for
> the millions of Americans who have been out of work for more than a year. 

This proposal is ridiculous from the onset because *that line of thought is what
landed us here.* Where does Salmon think that the $15.7 trillion debt came from?
I'll give you a hint: that tower of debt was built using the exact blueprint 
that Salmon is proposing here, which is to borrow and spend until... until...
the situation improves? 

Salmon is proposing to make yet another gamble, kin of which have failed
miserably, using as collateral the prosperity of the next generation. Are you
sure, Felix, that re-hiring Margaret the schoolteacher is really likely to
boost the economy to *not only cover the interest on debt incurred by her
reemployment*, but beat the gain in GDP that would have occurred had you left
money back in the pockets of businesses and individuals? I don't think the odds
are in your favor.

But this isn't about odds. This is about economic reality. And as long as
people *en masse* ignore the [discourses that have occurred long
ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man,_Economy,_and_State) on the nature of the
economic problems we face now, our circumstances aren't going to improve. I'm
not holding my breath.

I expect this kind of rhetoric out of the mouth of a politician, for want of
more power, but it is especially sad to see this broken logic come from a man
with presumably no political ties.
