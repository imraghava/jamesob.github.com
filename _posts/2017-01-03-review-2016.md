2016 went really fast, and a few big things happened. Some good, some bad.
There were some definite themes and I learned a few things. Here's a really
long post about it.

So what happened?

![dad](/images/dad.png){:style="width: 300px;"}

## My Dad died

On January 7th 2016, my Dad passed away. He'd had a four year battle with
[amyloidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis) and it'd been a 
tough fight.

I think about him every day. Often it isn't a gut-wrenching sadness, though
that usually comes the longer I think. It's more of an abstract sense of loss.
Like: what a shame he won't be here to meet the kids I hope to someday have. To
tell me about some weird Ingmar Bergman movie I hadn't seen.  What a shame we
can't sit together in the kitchen on holiday evenings, a fire roaring, him
telling me for the second or third time about how some obscure number theory
result is the reason we can buy things on the internet; making references to
Hesse and Hofstatder as though they were TV personalities. What a shame he
isn't here to watch my brothers and me continue to grow up and hopefully make
him proud.  Sometimes that plain sadness curdles into a sense of unfairness.

When he was diagnosed three years ago, I started getting severe symptoms of
anxiety and hypochondria. Panic attacks, scary physical sensations, days-long
fixations with the medical condition I'd surely soon collapse dead of. I'm
still wrestling with this today in degrees. 2015 saw a healthy regression of
this ailment, but Dad's death brought it back to some extent.

I've found myself hoping and maybe believing there's an afterlife so that
I can credibly tell myself he's still out there somewhere.

## Got back together with Karen

Karen and I had split the previous year in October. Dad's passing away left me
with a lot of thinking to do, and one of the things I realized is that Karen
has a character that is fundamentally good and darn rare.  She's kind and
caring, and has immense gumption and know-how. She has a thoughtful
courteousness that is unfortunately long out of fashion. She's damn funny, and
a bunch of other wonderful things that I won't list out here.

I lobbied hard to get back together with her and so far it's been a success.

I realized that a lot of the problems we hit the first time around were
problems with *me*, and they were repeat issues from past relationships. Not
taking enough space for myself, neglecting my friends, and eventually getting
fed up with my S.O.. Thinking that she has to be a mirror image of me for the
relationship to work. That was a big one. 

I'm sure these sound obviously dumb to
most people reading this, but somehow they got pretty deeply wired into my
thinking.

## I rewatched The Wire in its entirety

It's a great show, and still great the second time around. It'll teach you
about Baltimore politics, the varied and spectacular ways that hierarchical
bureaucracies fail, how to do right in spite of the people above you, and about
Omar. It'll sate your homesickness for the Rust Belt when you feel trapped in
the software-drunk hothouse of the west.

## Against everyone's better judgement, I wrote a deployment system

It was ill-advised and contrarian, but I wrote a AWS deployment
system called Herc that was pretty successful at Counsyl. It replaced our very
unreliable and difficult Docker cluster, and facilitated the deployment of
upwards of 15 separate services. It's maybe the single thing in my
career I'm most proud of. It was far from perfect, but it was kind of beautiful
in its effectiveness as a hot mess of duct-tape.

There were a few lessons here for me:

**Things that sound dumb by conventional wisdom may not be dumb given
particular conditions.** *Corollaries: there's no substitute for direct 
experience. Accept inherited wisdom cautiously. Assess things by first
principles.*

As most software engineers will tell you, writing a deployment system sounds
foolhardy. There are already a number of tools out there prebuilt and
well-tested that do this sort of thing. But when you have a giant legacy Puppet
codebase, an unconventional internal PKI infrastructure, HIPAA requirements,
and a bizarre AWS configuration, it just might make sense. And it did.

**Sometimes it's much better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.**

If I had navigated the proper channels to get permission to write and use this
thing, 90% odds are that I would've been refused, or this thing
would've turned into a big design-by-committee project.

Occasionally in people orgs, just a single individual has vision of what needs
to be done to improve the health of the org. Often there will be structural,
political impediments to this actually being realized. (see [Major
Colvin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9YgBF58Qks) of *The Wire*.) So
sometimes you just need to shirk those and go and do it.  Provide a proof of
concept and show people the value before they can argue it away. This'll do
wonders for your job satisfaction, though of course you might end up fired if
you don't think it through. You might end up fired anyway, but at least you'll
feel like you have some shred of integrity. 

**Working weekends isn't the devil.**

I wrote the kernel of this thing over a Saturday and Sunday. It's some of the
most fun I've ever had in my life.

**Software adoption is more about marketing than anyone gives outward
credit to.**

Having good docs, working examples, catchy branding, and an engaging talk
prepared was key to this system getting adopted in the org. Similar lessons
came from watching [desk](https://github.com/jamesob/desk/)'s rise to
(modest) popularity and implementing a frontend overhaul at Tempo.

## I changed jobs

I left [Counsyl](https://counsyl.com) and joined [Tempo
Automation](https://tempoautomation.com). Both are great companies, and I was
very well situated at Counsyl -- it mostly came down to the fact that Counsyl
is a Big Company (well, on the order of hundreds of people), and Tempo is a
small one. At smaller companies, the marginal impact of each employee on the
company is higher. I want to be somewhere where I matter.

The other, less diplomatic factor is that Counsyl's product (genetic labwork)
is quickly commoditizing and Tempo's product (tools to allow rapid prototyping
for electronics) is far from it.

## I started Crossfit

After a few years of basic and sporadic strength training with barbells
(squats, deadlifts, et al), I finally joined a Crossfit gym in September, which
has fully cemented my long-suspected membership in the
Crossfit-Paleo-Libertarian nexus. I've drank the all the koolaid there is to
drink. Rabid internet skeptics rejoice. 

I have mixed feelings about it so far. On the plus side:

- The coaching is excellent, and when you're a novice like me trying to throw
  115 pounds from floor to overhead in less than a second, you damn well better
  have an expert watching your form. I can't see olympic lifting (for long)
  without the foundation of good coaching.
- I'm pushed to do workouts I'd never complete otherwise.
- I look probably the best I ever have. But it's a different kind of look than
  strength training gets you, which is Big. This is more lean and defined.
- I feel really... fit? Even when I was doing strength training, I felt strong
  but running up a hill was still hard. Running up a hill is *still* hard, but
  I have a little more breath at the top. I have Crossfit's more diverse
  programming to thank for that.

On the minus side:

- That same diverse programming makes it pretty hard to track how I'm
  improving.  When you're grinding out fixed-rep squat schemes most sessions,
  it's pretty easy to tell how you're doing. With Crossfit it's not so clear.
- I don't appreciate the social aspect as much as other people probably do.
  Some days I'd really prefer just walking into the gym, putting on headphones,
  and grinding through a workout without a constant call to make smalltalk.
  I've found the Crossfit group very nice, but a little intimidating -- 
  some folks are too cool for school. This is probably my own insecurity coming
  through, and there's naturally gonna be some cohesion that you can't jump
  right into among a group that's been working out together for 3+ years.
- There is a competition/performance aspect to it that I'd mostly rather do
  without. As well-intended as it is, I find it pretty uncomfortable when
  people clap and cheer when I'm the last person struggling to finish a
  workout. I'd rather just wallow in my suboptimal fitness without anyone
  noticing (or throwing me pity cheers, anyway).
- It's *EXPENSIVE*. In SF we're talking ~$270/mo. with a six month contract.

All in all, though, the pros outweigh the cons for me at this point. When
I'm a seasoned vet, my clean/snatch form isn't complete garbage, and I have
a garage, I'll probably hang up the Crossfit. For now it's a worthwhile deal,
and I believe strongly in its efficacy for getting basically anyone into
very good shape quickly.

## I spent 14 days in Hong Kong and Japan

My first time in Asia was refreshing and instructive in weird, deep ways. I'd
recommend anyone with the means and interest check out Japan and Hong Kong, in
that order of priority. Both are great, but Japan is truly alien and wonderful.

Other travels:

- 4 trips to Virginia
- 3 trips to Yosemite
- 2 trips to Ohio
- 2 trips to Las Vegas
- 1 trip to LA for the Crossfit Games
- 1 trip to Vermont
- 1 trip to New York City

## I kept buying Bitcoin

And it's going pretty well. Back in April when the price was in the four
hundreds I seriously considered selling off the bulk of my VTSAX index funds
and sinking the yield into BTC, but I've got this "immutable trade" policy -- I
don't sell unless I need the money -- and so I figured it better to stick to my
principles. Boy that would've been a nice payoff, though.

## Looking forward to 2017

My plans for 2017 mostly revolve around responding to the issues I had in
2016. I've got more clear an idea of the directions I'd like to go versus 
previous years, so I'm pretty excited.

### More metrics

When I switched jobs to Tempo, many of the benefits of larger
software companies went away. No more regular free food, no more laundry. 
Oh boo-hoo, right? Software guy loses his perks. Well, yeah, and it's rough
after you've acclimated to that kind of pampering.

The back half of this year felt like nothing but working, Crossfit, cooking,
doing laundry, and then sleeping. I began to feel as though I wasn't making any
progress on personal projects (reading, coding, music, writing) and I got
pretty frustrated as a result.

So I'd like to get more quantitative with time monitoring. I've had an idea
kicking around for how to do this; how to build a model to both monitor and
nudge me in the right direction with time usage. I'd like to see that through.
Maybe there'll be a subsequent post more on that.

Generally I'd like to start keeping more metrics on things like

- how often I walk outside (preferably twice a day)
- how often I call/see my family (preferably more than I have been)
- how often I do intense workouts (preferably 5 times a week)
- how often I hike (preferably 2 times a week)
- how often I meditate
- how often I eat off-diet
- how much time I spend sitting per day
- how many micro-workouts I do per day (preferably 2)
- how much direct sunlight I get per day
- net worth

and so on.

### Stress reduction

Stress is bad for you and it isn't much fun. The back half of
the year saw me getting massively stressed out over work.

Much of this stress I probably saddled myself with, and I acknowledge that
some amount of stress probably spurs me to do better work and, more generally,
grow (see [hormesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis)). But too much
stress is bad, and a condition that sees me walking into work 
already keyed up every other day is probably too much stress.

So I'm going to try to loosen my grip a little. I don't want to turn into
some bland Zen prune, but upping the meditation and generally seeking more
relaxing, genuinely fun activities isn't gonna hurt.

### Put some skin in the game and make predictions

I'm very inspired by [the Slate Star Codex guy's yearly
ritual](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/12/31/2016-predictions-calibration-results/)
of making new predictions and grading last year's. I'm not going to any in this
post, but I'll be publishing some shortly.

It's been a horrible, wonderful year. Glad to be here.
