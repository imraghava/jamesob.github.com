Two days ago, I was walking south along Gallows Road in Virginia, which is
heavily trafficked by cars but not pedestrians. I was returning from an
expedition for coffee and had about a mile ahead of me to get back to the house
where I was staying. The air was humid and I had worked up a pretty good sweat.

The solitary walk got me thinking about the relationship between self-interest,
or the pursuit of wealth and self-preservation, and consideration for the
environment: two topics that I often see put at odds. 

If the engine of capitalism is society's means of production being owned 
privately, self-interest is certainly the fuel. Capitalism often has an
anti-environmental connotation, a common misattribution which I think is the
result of confusing self-interest with consumerism. 

The distinction is subtle and the implications of confusing the two are
drastic. As a cyclist, natural food advocate, cheapskate, and believer in
capitalism, I hope I can clear things up a little.

Take, for example, driving. Driving is pretty unanimously considered bad 
for the environment. The American Automobile Association [estimates that 
the average American spends $9,641 per year](http://gss.case.edu/RTAdocs/YourDrivingCosts2007.pdf)
on automobile-related costs. Someone who is strictly self-interested will 
consider that cost, then intersect it with the health benefits of 
[cycling to work](http://grist.org/cities/studies-show-that-bike-commuting-is-one-of-the-best-ways-to-stay-healthy/) 
(not to mention the [gains in safety](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/)),
and will be led to the fact that riding a bike to work is clearly preferable
to driving in, in terms of that individual's wellbeing. 

We didn't even ask what the most environmentally conscious option was, yet we
arrived at it by being self-interested.

Take, as another example, food: factory farming is another favorite badguy of
environmentalists. After spending a lot of time reading about the sort of food
I should eat to be healthiest, I became convinced that the [paleo
diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) is the way to go, which
recommends consuming lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and naturally-raised
animals. Even if you're not sold on paleo, it's commonly acknowledged that
fresh fruits and veggies are the way to go. This leads to buying from
vendors who produce their food in ways agreeable to the environment and
detracts business from those who don't.

Another huge wallet-vote for the environment, purely motivated by the desire
to look out for yourself.

So, we've seen a few examples, but why should this congeniality of the
environment and self-interest hold in a general sense? 

When individuals are focused on self-gain, they wind up maximizing use of
resources they have (including their health and wealth) and they shift from
consumption to production, which is how a positive net worth[^0] happens. 

This is all provided that the individual is capable of discerning what is most
beneficial for him or her. How best can we motivate that? You might try upping
personal responsibility.
