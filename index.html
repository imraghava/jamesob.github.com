    <p>I live in Alexandria, VA, and work at <a
      href="http://phase2technology.com">Phase2 Technology</a>.  I like making
    things that are fun to use. My goal is to become an awesome full-stack web
    developer. I like Unix and its philosophies a whole lot.</p>
   
<p>I also like detective stories, vim, The Doors, city lights, hot coffee, and a few other
things. I recently completed a <a href="http://ahadventure.us">bike trip from
  Virginia to San Francisco</a> that made a big impact on me.</p>
