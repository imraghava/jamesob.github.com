    I'm a Python-hacking math dropout who likes to write. I live
    in Northern Virginia, work on <a
      href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/">numerical analysis software</a>, go
    to school sometimes, practice armchair economics, and try to think of things
    to make. I'm interested in design, tools, and dressing like a drugged-up
    cowboy.
