      <li>

      <p>We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember
      always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon
      evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of
      another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig
      deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that <b>we are not
      descended from fearful men</b> â€” not from men who feared to write, to speak,
      to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular. 
      </p>
      <p><i>Edward R. Murrow</i></p>

      <li>
      <p>Prosperity comes to the mob, and to low-minded men as well as to great
      ones; but it is the privilege of great men alone to send under the yoke
      the disasters and terrors of mortal life: whereas to be always
      prosperous, and to pass through life without a twinge of mental distress,
      is to remain ignorant of one half of nature.</p>
      <p><i>Seneca</i></p>
