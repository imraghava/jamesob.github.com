      <p>We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember
      always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon
      evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of
      another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig
      deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that <b>we are not
      descended from fearful men</b> â€” not from men who feared to write, to speak,
      to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular. 
      </p>
      <p><i>Edward R. Murrow</i></p>
